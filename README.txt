Was made with HackerRank online IDE
program name: morgan and a string

this function takes 2 strings that act like a stack of chars. It can only pick off the top of one stack or the other.
it creates a new string that is optimally alphabetized.

sounds easy?

consider:

stack 1: BBBBZZ
stack 2: BBBBAA

correct output: BBBBAABBBBZZ
not:            BBBBBBBBAAZZ
